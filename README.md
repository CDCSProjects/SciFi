# AssetStore

*downloadAndBuild.sh* is a **completely untested** script for downloading rocksdb and duckdb, and for building everything.

## Examples

*SimpleStore.cpp* shows a minimal example to create a store and a shell, and to tun the shell

*ASDemo.cpp* shows how to add functions to the shell and how to access the store directly + some time measurement. **NOTE** The source of the input files here is hard coded, change the path to something that exists on your drive.

All other examples were used for our paper to demonstrate the speed of different operations, e.g. writing datasets to main memory.

Actual documentation is going to be here...some day.
